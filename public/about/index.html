		<h1>About standouthost.com</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Standouthost was a game hosting business I ran to pay for the physical server my minecraft community had grown into. I started the community in my Silver Spring apartment on a laptop, eventually moved it to a few virtual servers, before the need to go big and get a physical server with Hetzner in germany. We didnt need the entire server so it made sense to spin up a company and rent the rest of the server to pay for what we needed.</p>

<p>The business took off and I ended up running it for 5 or so years based on word of mouth only, I used the multicraft panel, and coded quite a few mods for it to support any game server that would run on Linux. See the github page for it <a href="https://github.com/Standouthost/Multicraft">here</a></p>

<p>Though I let the business wither out and no longer host for anyone other myself, I still have the servers with hetzner and standouthost has now become my infrastructure domain.</p>

<p>I have two physical servers which run the majority of my online presence, a bunch of vm&rsquo;s, a bunch of docker, this website and others. I keep the domain name because its cheap and why not.</p>

<p>Its also why my twitter handle is standouthost, as I was only intending to use twitter to promote the business, and then at Red Hat all the cool kids wanted me to be on twitter so I kept using it.</p>

<p>I purchased the sister domain soh.re for a shortname to give each of the customer minecraft servers a custom domain, soh.re is now my favorite domain name I own and I use it for my mail server, and a really cool terminal based website I use for promoting myself. Check it out <a href="https://soh.re">https://soh.re</a></p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
