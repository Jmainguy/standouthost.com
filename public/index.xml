      <description>Standouthost was a game hosting business I ran to pay for the physical server my minecraft community had grown into. I started the community in my Silver Spring apartment on a laptop, eventually moved it to a few virtual servers, before the need to go big and get a physical server with Hetzner in germany. We didnt need the entire server so it made sense to spin up a company and rent the rest of the server to pay for what we needed.</description>
